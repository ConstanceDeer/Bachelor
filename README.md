## GIF folder
In the folder GIFs four GIFs are found, produced in this thesis: <br><br>
*Animation_large.gif*: Is the simulation of the wave pattern produced by the largest iceberg. <br><br>
*Animation_small.gif*: Is the simulation of the wave pattern produced by the smallest iceberg.<br><br>
*June_250m_Geoid_5351_V2.gif*: Is the ocean surface topography data in the interest period and area. <br><br>
*June_250m_MSS_5351_0.15.gif*: Is the sea surface height anomaly data for the interest period and area.<br><br>

## Code folder
In the folder Code are the code produced in the thesis present. In the thesis the code from the SWOT-OpenToolkit GitHup reposatory is used and code from PDE-solver-shallow-water-equations GitHub reposatory by Carl Zhu is used.  <br> <br>
*GIF_maker.py*: Code done to generate the given plots and GIFs of OST and SSHA  <br><br>
*Cross_section_and_Iceberg_Code.p*: Code used to make iceberg movement analysis and also include cross-section analysis.  <br> <br>
*PDS_code.py*: Code used for the spacial power spectral density analysis.  <br><br>
*SWE_model_t_vari.py*: Code used for the simulation and making of the GIFs.  <br><br>
*pass_plots.py*: Plot illustrating the passes of 1-Day orbit.  <br><br>
*sigma0_resheach.py*: Code for the Normalized Radar Cross-Section plots.  <br><br>
